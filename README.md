## About this bot

This bot was originally conceived by (community member and moderator) [FantasyCookie17](https://artemislena.eu) as a way to quickly answer common questions asked in our online communities. This is a community project, with answers ideally representing the consensus of the community. Thus, pull requests are very welcome. Questions and answers can be added to [`faq.json`](/faq.json).

This bot is a fork of [@fire219/pine-faq-bot](https://github.com/fire219/pine-faq-bot), and below you will find the original documentation, with slight modifications to fit this custom fork:

## A simple question-response Matrix bot, built on matrix-nio API

Built out of necessity, this easy to use and manage Matrix bot will give recorded responses from its JSON file.

**Example:**

    Random User: !faq pbpOS
    Pine64 FAQ Bot: [FAQbot] Which OS you should run depends on what you prefer. Well supported options are Debian (default on all PBPs), Ubuntu, and Manjaro.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.5+ (uses async/await syntax)
- matrix-nio library (`pip install matrix-nio`)
- Git
- A user account on a Matrix homeserver

### Setup:
After downloading the bot files, create a new file named `login.json`.
Create the following structure in the file and fill in the relevant blanks:

    {"homeserver": "<homeserver URL>", "username": "<@botuser:matrix.org>", "password": "<examplepassword>", "botadmin": "<@you:matrix.org>"}

After saving this file, the bot is ready to use. As downloaded, your bot will have the latest version of the Techlore room FAQ file within `faq.json`. However, it can easily be edited to fit your needs.

### Special commands:
Most !faq commands will simply be looked up within the FAQ listings. However, a few commands are reserved:

 Command| Description
--|--
 !faq shutdown | Shuts down the bot. Can only be triggered by `botadmin`, else gives default FAQ error.
 !faq update | `git pull`s in the current directory. This both updates the FAQ file and, if you shut it down subsequently, allows you to run the latest version of the source code.
 !faq | Gives an index listing of all currently loaded FAQ queries.
